## VI. EXTRA TOOLS

In the Extra Preprocessing Tools folder of the project, we give a variety of different auxiliary signal, data processing tools for radar based human activity recognition. These include the classical FFT, HHT, TFD, WT, VMD algorithms, and so on. This part of the code is referenced from the TWHD repository uploaded by other teams and slightly improved for processing reference.
