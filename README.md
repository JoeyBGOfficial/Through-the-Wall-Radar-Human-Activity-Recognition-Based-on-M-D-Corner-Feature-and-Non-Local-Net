# Through-the-Wall-Radar-Human-Activity-Recognition-Based-on-M-D-Corner-Feature-and-Non-Local-Net

## I. INTRODUCTION

**Motivation:** The reason we're willing to put in the effort to do this is because through-the-wall radar human activity recognition is a worthwhile research problem because it can provide non-contact, real-time human movement monitoring and recognition, with a wide range of potential applications in areas such as urban safety and disaster rescue. Open-source efforts can foster collaboration and innovation in the field, advancing the technology and enabling it to benefit the wider research community.

**Abstract:** Through-the-wall radar is able to penetrate walls and achieve indoor human target detection. Deep learning is commonly used to extract the micro-Doppler signature, which can be used to effectively identify abnormal human activities behind obstacles. However, when different testers are invited to generate the training set and test set, the test accuracy of deep-learning-based recognition method is low with poor generalization ability. Therefore, this paper proposes an abnormal human activity recognition method based on micro-Doppler corner features and Non-Local mechanism. In this method, Harris and Moravec detectors are utilized to extract the corner features on the radar image, and the corner feature dataset is established in this manner. Then, multi-link parallel convolutions and Non-Local mechanism are utilized to construct the global contextual information extraction network to learn the global distribution characteristics of image pixels. The semantic feature maps are generated by repeating the global contextual information extraction network four times. Finally, the predicted probabilities of human activities are obtained by multi-layer perceptron. Numerical simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that the proposed method can identify sudden abnormal human activities, and improve the recognition accuracy, generalization ability and robustness.
